# RISC-V-single-cycle-processor
RISC-V RV32I Microarchitecture Design using Verilog HDL.

This project presents the design and implementation of a single cycle RISC-V RV32I processor on FPGA
using Xilinx ISE Design Suite. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture that provides flexibility, scalability
and privilege from proprietary constraints, making it an excellent choice for educational purposes. The processor is
designed using Verilog HDL, includes essential components such as the instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory
access and write-back stages.

The entire design is synthesized and implemented on a Spartan-6 FPGA board. This project demonstrates the feasibility
and effectiveness of implementing a single cycle RISC-V processor on FPGA, providing valuable insights into processor
design and hardware implementation.
